Need:

LBFGS

Exponentiated gradient

Nelder-Mead

Primal-Dual Convex optimization method

Matrix inversion / standard matrix ops

What serves me best long term?
    Should I just import existing solvers in CPP and C? (CppNumericalSolvers project)
    Should I write my own?
    Should I port CppNumericalSolvers to D with Mir?
